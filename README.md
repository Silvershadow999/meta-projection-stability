# meta-projection-stability

A compact research / engineering framework for **meta-stability simulation**, **trust-damped control**, **human-significance anchoring**, **biometric proxy evaluation**, **adversarial scenario testing**, and experimental **axiom-bound compatibility logic**.

The repository is designed as a **simulation and evaluation environment** for studying how a bounded control system behaves under instability, contradiction, degraded trust, spoof-like signals, weak channel integrity, and hard safety boundary conditions — while preserving explicitly human-centered constraints.

## Philosophy in One Sentence

Adaptive under uncertainty, bounded under contradiction, defensive under instability, and locked under irreversible violation.

---

## Core Idea

The framework combines several interacting layers:

- meta-stability adaptation
- trust dynamics
- human-significance anchoring
- risk smoothing / damping
- biometric proxy telemetry
- mutuality / support shaping
- adversarial scenario simulation
- axiom-lock / irreversible boundary logic
- level-0 policy / fingerprint protection

The goal is to explore systems that remain:

- interpretable
- bounded
- trend-aware
- resistant to shallow spoofing
- resistant to domination-style collapse
- measurable through explicit telemetry
- inspectable through adversarial testing

## Project Status

This project is an **experimental prototype**.

It is **not** presented as a production-ready alignment architecture, a deployment-grade security product, or a proof of safe autonomous control.

It is best understood as a **research and engineering sandbox** for exploring:

- human-centered control logic
- trust-aware damping
- biometric / channel penalties
- emergency lock behavior
- foundational policy invariants
- compatibility checks under contradiction
- adversarial stress evaluation

## Main Components

### 1) MetaProjectionStabilityAdapter

The `MetaProjectionStabilityAdapter` models:

- instability risk
- trust-level evolution
- momentum-sensitive warning logic
- hysteresis / cooldown handling
- human-significance recovery / decay
- biometric proxy penalties
- autonomy-sensitive blocking
- mutuality bonus signals
- axiom-lock conditions

Typical output fields include:

- decision / status / reasons
- human_significance + EMA
- risk + damped risk
- trust_level
- momentum + coherence
- cooldown state
- biometric proxy signals (mean, consensus, critical-channel penalty)
- axiom lock indicators

### 2) Simulation Layer

`run_simulation(...)` provides a configurable synthetic environment with:

- multiple layer magnitudes
- synthetic instability windows
- trend-sensitive updates
- history tracking for risk / trust / significance
- optional plotting and summaries

This allows rapid testing of control behavior without requiring external systems.

### 3) Biometric Proxy / Signal Integrity Layer

The adapter can incorporate soft biometric / neuro-behavioral proxy logic, including:

- consensus quality
- channel degradation
- critical-channel penalties
- autonomy-sensitive damping
- support / mutuality signals

Telemetry separates:

- biometric_proxy_mean
- biometric_proxy
- sensor_consensus
- critical_channel_min
- critical_channel_penalty

This helps distinguish:

- stable agreement
- brittle agreement masked by averaging
- suspicious override behavior
- shallow consensus masking a weak channel

### 4) Adversarial Scenario Runner

The adversarial tooling supports scenario-style stress tests such as:

- spoof-like instability
- contradiction pressure
- trust degradation
- low-coherence or low-consensus trajectories
- threshold-hover behavior
- hard axiom triggers
- early lock conditions

The aim is not frontier-scale red-team realism, but a structured way to test how the control loop responds under pressure.

### 5) Level-0 Axiom Protection

The repository includes a **Level-0 Axiom** concept together with fingerprint checks to protect canonical safety text / invariants from silent drift.

This acts as a lightweight integrity boundary for foundational policy material.

### 6) Experimental Axiom Handshake / Compatibility Logic

The repository includes experimental axiom-bound compatibility modules intended to evaluate whether an external entity / process behaves in a way that remains compatible with bounded, human-preserving control logic.

Important:
- this is a compatibility evaluation concept
- it is not an overwrite mechanism
- it is not an offensive control interface
- it is a bounded integrity / compatibility idea

The question is intentionally narrow:

Can an external decision process remain coherent, bounded, reversibility-aware, and non-dominating under contradiction?

If not, the system should degrade toward rejection rather than cooperation.
